Flutter Ecommerce App.

Excited to share my latest project with you all! As a programmer working in Dart/Flutter, I developed an ecommerce application using DDD architecture with bloc state management and getx state management for routing.

The app features an authentication system that is implemented using Google Auth and Phone Auth with Firebase services. Users can log in using their Google account or phone number, and their profile details, including name, email/phone number, profile picture, and Firebase user ID, are displayed in a side drawer.

The home screen displays food products listed from an API, and users can easily add any product to their cart and increment or decrement its quantity from the home screen itself. The cart is implemented using Hive database, where the products added to the cart are stored before placing the order. The cart screen displays the added products, and users can increment or decrement the quantity of each product. Placing an order clears the cart and navigates the user back to the home screen.

I am proud to say that I completed this project in just five days without compromising the quality and user experience, and I have handled most exceptions to ensure the expected working of the application. I actually created this app for a machine test in a company, and I am sharing the APK as well as the GitHub link for anyone interested in testing and reviewing the code. This project can serve as a base reference for enterprise-level scalable ecommerce applications in DDD architecture with Firebase authentication and local database for the cart.

I welcome any suggestions and corrections, as I am always open to learning and improving my skills. Thank you for reading!
